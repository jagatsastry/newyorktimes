Tools
===============================================================================
The New York Times Corpus includes software written in the Java Programming Language for parsing corpus documents from xml into a memory resident object. The tools can be found in the 'tools/' directory, which is arranged as follows:

tools/src
	The source code for the tools.

tools/build/timestools.jar
	A jarfile containing the compiled tools.
	
tools/docs/
-	Javadocs for the tools classes

To build the tools from source, you must have apache ant installed (http://ant.apache.org/).  Once ant is installed, change into the 'tools' directory and issue the command 'ant'.  This will create a file 'timestools.jar' in the 'tools/build/' directory. 

Below is an example of how to  use the tools in your java programs.

import com.nytlabs.ldc.NYTimesLDCDocumentParser;
import com.nytlabs.util.Utilities;

...

	NYTimesLDCDocumentParser parser = new NYTimesLDCDocumentParser();
	File file = new File("/docs/1987/01/01/0000001.xml");
	NYTimesLDCDocument timesDocument = 	
		parser.parseNYTimesLDCDocumentFromFile(file, false);
...
